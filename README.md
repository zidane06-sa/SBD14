# Reservo 🍽️

A full-stack restaurant table reservation system built as a final project for the Database Systems (SBD) practicum. Reservo allows customers to discover restaurants, browse available tables, and book sessions — while giving admins full control over restaurant management, table availability, and reservation approvals.

# Features

## Customer

- **Discover** — Browse and search restaurants by name or cuisine type
- **Session-based Booking** — Each restaurant has auto-generated 90-minute sessions based on its opening/closing hours. Customers pick a date, select consecutive sessions, and choose an available table
- **Smart Availability** — Sessions already booked by others appear grayed out and are unselectable

### Booking Rules
- Booking **H-2 or earlier** → auto-confirmed immediately, table marked as reserved
- Booking **H or H-1** → sent as pending request, requires admin approval

### Additional Features
- **My Reservations** — Track all past and upcoming bookings with full status visibility
- **Rejection Reason** — If a reservation is rejected, the admin's reason is shown in the customer's dashboard
- **Cancel** — Customers can cancel pending or confirmed reservations
- **Favorites** — Save restaurants for quick access

---

## Admin

- **Add Restaurant** — Create new restaurants with full details (name, cuisine, address, city, hours, phone)
- **Add Table** — Assign tables to restaurants with capacity, location, and initial status
- **Schedule View** — Per-restaurant table grid showing availability per session per date, color-coded:
  - Green = available
  - Red = booked
  - Gray = maintenance
- **Table Status Management** — Change individual table status directly from the schedule grid
- **Incoming Requests** — Review pending H/H-1 reservations with customer and booking details
- **Check Availability** — Admin can open the full schedule for the selected restaurant/date before deciding
- **Approve** — Confirm reservation; table status auto-updates to reserved
- **Reject** — Reject reservation with required written reason surfaced to customer
- **Delete Restaurant / Table** — Remove entries with confirmation modal

# Booking Logic

```txt
Customer selects date
        │
        ├── H-2 or earlier ──→ Auto-confirmed + table marked reserved
        │
        └── H or H-1 ────────→ Status: pending
                                        │
                                Admin reviews request
                                        │
                          ┌─────────────┴──────────────┐
                        Approve                      Reject
                          │                            │
                  Status: confirmed            Status: rejected
                  Table → reserved             rejection_reason
                                               surfaced to customer
```

Sessions are generated automatically from restaurant opening/closing times in 90-minute blocks. Customers can book multiple consecutive sessions stored as a single reservation.
